                    I'm Sebastian Kuipers, born and raised in Haarlem. I've been very interested in computers and technology from a young age. In my free time, I have done several projects already to teach myself how it all works. I first started out as a university student, but it didn't quite fit with me and thus I ended up in college doing IT.
                    In my free time, I often play video games. I am also part of a chill scouting group where we love to hang out, chill and just have a fun time. I have also practiced scuba diving for multiple years, albeit I took a short break during my studies due to time constraints.
